# DIYNeuralNetwork
A java based neural-network layout created without the use of pre-existing libraries. The network has training and testing capabilities and has the underlying data structure of a directional weighted graph.

(The basic use-case implemented is training an AI that can add one to a number. It is quite simple and only requires one hidden layer. Only implemented for a proof of concept of the neural network structure and validity.)
